## Background

Data analytics in sports is no new occurrence, but extensive empirical analysis has only recently made its way to the NFL field. With the advent of advanced player-tracking data collection technology, there has been more effective means to conduct meaningful data analysis that can affect the result of NFL games. More and more are we seeing teams using data to create a playbook or even evaluate a personnel decision. It changes how a team drafts, calls plays, and evaluates opponents. All these shifts point to the extreme value of data analytics for an NFL team. 

As a diehard Cincinnati Bengals fan, I have had to watch as my beloved hometown team performs abysmally year after year. With no expectation of improvement anytime soon (they are currently 1-12 at the time this was written), I wanted to conduct some data analysis and statistical modeling to get to the core of the problem. For my project, I chose to analyze data from the 2018 NFL Season, focusing specifically on the detailed play-by-play data from the 2018 season to try and answer the ultimate question of what drives points, win probability, and subsequently wins.

                             
## The Data

I pulled the data from the “nflscrapR” package on Github that was widely regarded as the most comprehensive R package for NFL Analysis. The package was built to allow R users to utilize and analyze data from the National Football League (NFL) API. The package allows me to analyze play-by-play data on the individual game level and for entire seasons. Each play contains more than 250 different variables that allow users to analyze detailed facets of a game or play at a more granular level. The nflscrapR package includes a Expected Points and Win Probability Model (details here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998)

Within the package the data ranges from the 2009 to 2018 seasons. Additionally, the package allows for the scraping of roster and player data that allowed me to gather basic player data for a cursory player demographic analysis.
