## Background

As a diehard Cincinnati Bengals fan, I have had to watch as my beloved hometown team performs abysmally year after year. With no expectation of improvement anytime soon (they are currently 1-11 at the time this was written), I wanted to conduct some data analysis and statistical modeling to get to the core of the problem. 
For my project, I will analyze data from the 2018 NFL Season, focusing specifically on the detailed play-by-play data from the 2018 season to try and answer the ultimate question of what drives points and subsequently wins. 
                             
## The Data

I pulled the data from the nflscrapR package on github that was widely regarded as the most comprehensive R package for NFL Analysis. Within the package there is general game data from 2009-2018, but also play-by-play data for each game. The nflscrapR package includes a Expected Points and Win Probability Model (details here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998)

Additionally, I also pulled a csv file (Basic_Stats.csv) from an online database that includes basic player data for almost every current and previous NFL player.
